<br><h4>Libft is the first project of <a href="https://www.42madrid.com/">42 School</a> Common-Core. With the idea of having a first contact with the low-level language C, we will create our own
  implementations of some very known functions of C and Java. This project can be used in some other parts of the Common-Core, so you don't have to create them
  every time or just import the original ones (which is forbidden).<br>
<br>âœ¨--- This project is done following 42 Norminette, so the code has the cleanest appearance possible.
<br>ðŸŽˆ--- Includes the bonus part, which is about linked lists.
<br>ðŸŽ¯--- Moulinette and <a href="https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette">Francinette</a> (also strict) approved this project.
<br>ðŸ•‘--- Finished: 22th October 2023
